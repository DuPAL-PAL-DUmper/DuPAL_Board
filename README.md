## Introduction

The DuPAL boards are tools meant to help in dumping/reversing the content of some PLDs and memories.

The original DuPAL revision 2, currently supported by most tools, but limited in support to PAL devices (with the exclusion of PAL22) can be found [here](https://github.com/DuPAL-PAL-DUmper/DuPAL_Board/tree/master/board/DuPal_DIP).

The [DuPAL V3](https://github.com/DuPAL-PAL-DUmper/DuPAL_Board/tree/master/board/DuPal_V3), AKA "dupico", has more potential and will eventually support a much larger number of devices, but most of the tools have not yet been ported to it. Adapter pods for the dupico can be found [here](https://github.com/DuPAL-PAL-DUmper/DuPAL_Board/tree/master/board/dupico_pods).
